# Alkindus
Hardware &amp; Software PGP communication using ESP32s

This is currently a WIP, still in the planning stages. Looking to document everything in this project.
Due to a 100% workload semester this will be worked on lightly when I get time. This might be a full-time project when this semester is over.


Name Inspiration:
